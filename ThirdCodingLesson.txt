C++ Lesson 3

The CPU has three main components: the arithmetic and logical Unit, the Register, and the Control Unit.

The computer also contains RAM or primary memory/storage that sends the input, which is binary code/machine language (0s and 1s), into the CPY. The RAM cannot store the data without power.

The arithmetic and logical unit - is responsible for the processing of the input data. 

Control unit -  is responsible for controlling the CPU and communicating with the rest of the motherboard.

The smallest measure of information in computers is the Bit.

Information measures in computer:

1 bit - > 0 or 1
8 bit - > 1 Byte
1024 Bytes - > 1 MegaByte (MB)
1024 MB - > GigaByte (GB)
1024 GB - > 1 TeraByte (TB)
1024 TB - > 1 PetaByte (PB)
1024 PB - > 1 ExaByte (EB) 

Ram is usually from 8 to ~ 128 GB.

The CPU will fetch the data (a few MB) from the RAM and cache is in the Register unit.

The secondary storage are HDD, SSD…


In modern CPU’s the arithmetic and logical unit will have different cors. This allows you to execute the calculations/code simultaneously.
